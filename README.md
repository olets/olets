## Writing

Read articles I've written on a range of web dev topics at [olets.dev](https://www.olets.dev/).

## Stats

The repository view count statistics and total lines of code modified are probably somewhat inaccurate. Repositories that were last contributed to more than a year ago may not be included. Only public repos are analyzed (private repos would add more LESS, PHP, and Sass, and lot more Twig). And of course doesn't take into account repos under my Codeberg account <https://codeberg.org/olets/>.
