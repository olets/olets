# [BLACK LIVES MATTER](https://blacklivesmatter.com/)

> He/him/his. I [live on](https://native-land.ca/) Sissipahaw, Eno, Sappony, Catawba, and Shakori land.

_Work with me! Viget is hiring <https://viget.com/careers> (currently fully remote). It's a great place to be, happy to answer any questions over email._

&nbsp;

I make accessible responsive front ends for websites small and large, CMS-backed or not. In a typical week I work on Node, PHP, and Rails stacks. I think about information architecture and presentation, mentorship and knowledge sharing, code reviews and team strength, collaboration and contribution. I enjoy writing utilities and build pipelines. Before this I was in cognitive neuroscience of mental disorders. Skill with smallest market: clay court croquet court restoration.

## Microprototypes

Proof of concept fiddles I've made to test out one thing or another. Mostly CSS demos — for JS I typically prototype locally with my standard tooling. Mostly using `slim` for markup and `stylus` for styles because they require the fewest Codepen keystrokes. Placeholder images come from CDNs; I cannot make any guarantees about their content. Maybe you'll find some useful.
