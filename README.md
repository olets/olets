> He/him/his. I [live on](https://native-land.ca/) Sissipahaw, Eno, Sappony, Catawba, and Shakori land. Black lives matter; in many places systems and individuals deny this as well as the equal worth of other groups of people who are not white, or not male, or not cis-gendered, or not heterosexual, or differently abled, or in some other way different from those who command the greatest privilege. In some instances the denial is not deliberate but in many instances it is deliberate; in some instances it is made without understanding but in many instances it is made with understanding. Racism hurts and kills, and so do so many other divisions predicated on differences of body or mind. I do not presume that this notice is stated perfectly; it will change or be removed if it does harm (don't hesitate to let me know).

I make accessible responsive front ends for websites small and large, CMS-backed or not. In a typical week I work on Node, PHP, and Rails stacks. I think about information architecture and presentation, mentorship and knowledge sharing, code reviews and team strength, collaboration and contribution. I enjoy writing utilities and build pipelines. Before this I was in cognitive neuroscience of mental disorders. Skill with smallest market: clay court croquet court restoration.
